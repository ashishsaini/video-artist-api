#Summerize the text in pointers with each pointer less than 25 words\n\nBitcoin has traded mostly sideways over the past two weeks, prompting some traders to consider alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether for greater profit potential.\n\n“Our models are still full risk-on ETH (whereas our bitcoin model started reducing exposure last week) but we are starting to see some slowing in conviction buying,” Ben McMillan, chief investment officer at quantitative research firm IDX Insights, wrote in a research report.\n\nBTC’s price has been roughly flat over the past week, compared with a 4% rise in ETH and a 23% rise in Solana’s SOL token over the same period.\n\n“Investors are likely looking for the next catalyst for another leg higher, but the absence of such is likely to leave bitcoin vulnerable to a break below $60,000,” Daniela Hathorn, an analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.\n\nPointers:\n* Bitcoin has traded mostly sideways over the past two weeks\n* Last week BTC’s price has been roughly flat,  with a +4% rise in ETH\n* Investors are looking for next catalyst for big jump, otherwise bitcoin may go below $60,000\n\n####\n\n#Summerize the text in pointers with each pointer less than 15 words\n\nQuantum computers process information differently. Classical computers use transistors, which are either 1 or 0. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be 1 or 0 at the same time. The number of qubits linked together increases the quantum computing power exponentially. Meanwhile, linking together more transistors only increases power linearly.\n\nClassical computers are best for everyday tasks that need to be completed by a computer. Meanwhile, quantum computers are great for running simulations and data analyses, such as for chemical or drug trials. These computers must be kept ultra-cold, however. They are also much more expensive and difficult to build.3 \n\nClassical computing advances include adding memory to speed up computers. Meanwhile, quantum computers help solve more complicated problems. While quantum computers might not run Microsoft Word better or faster, they can run complex problems faster.\n\nFor example, Google’s quantum computer that’s in development could help with many processes, such as speed up machine-learning training or help create more energy-efficient batteries.2\n\nQuantum computing has a number of other applications, including securely sharing information. Other methods include fighting cancer and various health concerns, such as cancer and developing new drugs. As well, quantum computers can help improve radars and their ability to detect such things as missiles and aircraft. Other areas include the environment and using quantum computing to keep the water clean with chemical sensors.\n\nPointers: \n* Quantum computers process information differently \n* Quantum computers are great for running simulations, data analyses, such as for chemical or drug trials\n* While quantum computers might not run Word better, they can run complex problems faster\n* Other applications include securely sharing information\n* Quantum computers can help with speeding up machine-learning training or more energy-efficient batteries \n* Using quantum computing to keep the water clean with chemical sensors\n
